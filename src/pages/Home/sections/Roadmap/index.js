After discussion with some of the most influential people in the NFT and Crypto industry, we are currently working to bring them to the events. But shhhh. Let's keep it secret for the moment ðŸ˜‰

All events will be private, only for our holders. Food and drinks will be provided for all holders. Legendary holders will be invited to events with an all inclusive package (flight, hotel, food, drinks and special activities). Imagine yourself with all Shiba members, holding a glass of champagne and hanging out with celebrities. 

Since we know that some of our Club Members will not be able to attend, we will broadcast all of our events LIVE, and soon in the metaverse...`,
